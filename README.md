# CNN Research on CIFAR-10 Dataset

This project explores Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using the CIFAR-10 dataset. It includes training a CNN, visualizing filters, creating activation heatmaps, and generating adversarial examples to test the model's robustness.

##  Model Training

A custom CNN was built and trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset using PyTorch.  
The model achieves over **65% accuracy** on the test set, satisfying the requirement for reliability.

##  Filter Visualization 

The filters (kernels) from the **first and middle convolutional layers** were visualized.  
These show what visual features each filter is "looking for" â€” for example, edges, colors, or textures.

---

##  Activation Heatmaps

Activation heatmaps were generated by passing images through the network and visualizing the outputs of specific layers.  

Additionally:
- Portions of images were masked (occluded)
- The resulting activation changes were visualized
- This shows which image regions the network pays attention to

##  Adversarial Example

A minimally modified version of an image was created (adversarial example) that tricks the trained model into misclassifying the image â€” even though it still appears nearly identical to a human viewer.
